        <h1 id="h11">Why are trees important ?</h1>
        <ul id="o1">
            <li>Absorb and store carbon</li>
            <li>Provide Oxygen</li>
            <li>Provide Good Shelter</li>
            <li>Trees leaves Used in medicians</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p1">Trees reduce the 'Greenhouse' effect by removing carbon dioxide from the air and releasing oxygen. </br>
            Each year a mature tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people. </br>
            Trees are also an effective sound barrier and can limit noise pollution.</br>
             Recent research shows that trees also help reduce the stress of modern life.</p>
        <h1 id="h21">Personal & Spiritual Value</h1>
        <p id="p21">The main reason we like trees is because they are both beautiful and majestic. No two are alike. Different species display a seemingly endless variety of shapes, forms, textures and vibrant colors.</br>
             Even individual trees vary their appearance throughout the course of the year as the seasons change. The strength, long lifespan and regal stature of trees give them a monument-like quality.</br>
              Most of us react to the presence of trees with a pleasant, relaxed, comfortable feeling. In fact, many people plant trees as living memorials of life-changing events.</p>
        <h1 class="jk">Practical & Commercial Value</h1>
        <p class="n">Trees have supported and sustained life throughout our existence. They have a wide variety of practical and commercial uses. Wood was the very first fuel, and is still used for cooking and heating by about half of the worldâ€™s population.</br>
             Trees provide timber for building construction, furniture manufacture, tools, sporting equipment, and thousands of household items. Wood pulp is used to make paper.</p>
